-----------------------------What is a Web Browser? + How to distribute it to the clients?----------------------------

If you've developed a web browser using Python, it's important to understand that web browsers are typically
client-side applications installed and run on individual devices, rather than being hosted on servers like
traditional web applications.

However, if you've developed a web browser with additional features or functionality that you want to make accessible
to others, you might consider distributing it as a standalone application rather than hosting it on a server.

Here are some steps you can take to distribute your Python-based web browser:

1. Package Your Application: Use packaging tools like PyInstaller or Py2exe to create standalone executable files for
   your web browser application. This will bundle all necessary Python dependencies and resources into a single
   package that users can download and run on their devices.

2. Distribute Your Application: Once you've packaged your web browser application, you can distribute it through
   various channels:
   i. Upload it to a file-sharing platform like GitHub Releases, Dropbox, or Google Drive, and share the download link
      with others.
   ii. Distribute it through software distribution platforms like Steam, the Microsoft Store, or the Mac App Store,
       depending on your target platform.
   iii. Create an installer for your application using tools like Inno Setup (for Windows) or PackageMaker (for macOS)
        and distribute it through your own website or other channels.

3. Promote Your Application: Spread the word about your web browser application through social media, forums, and
   communities related to software development, web browsing, and Python programming. Encourage users to try out
   your application and provide feedback.

4. Provide Support and Updates: Once your web browser application is released, be prepared to provide support to
   users and release updates to address any issues or add new features. Consider setting up a support email address
   or forum where users can report bugs and ask questions.

It's important to note that distributing standalone applications comes with its own set of challenges, such as
ensuring compatibility across different operating systems and managing user feedback and support. Make sure to
thoroughly test your application on various platforms and address any issues before releasing it to the public.

Overall, while hosting a web browser itself on a server is not a typical scenario, you can distribute your
Python-based web browser application as a standalone executable to make it accessible to users.

-------------------------------------------Use of PyInstaller(a Packaging tool)----------------------------------------

PyInstaller is a popular Python library used to package Python applications into standalone executables, which can
be distributed and run on other machines without requiring Python to be installed.

Here's how you can use PyInstaller to package your Python-based web browser application:

1. Install PyInstaller: First, you need to install PyInstaller. You can do this via pip, the Python package
   manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```
    pip install pyinstaller
    ```

2. Package Your Application:

   * To open terminal - Windows/Linux: Alt + F12

   a. Navigate to the directory containing your Python web browser application files using the command line.

   b. Run the following command to package your application into a standalone executable:

    ```
    pyinstaller your_script.py

    or

    python -m PyInstaller --onefile your_script.py
    (helped from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70227771/i-cant-use-pyinstaller)
    ```

    Replace `your_script.py` with the main Python script file of your web browser application. PyInstaller
    will analyze your script, gather all its dependencies, and create a standalone executable in a `dist`
    directory within your project folder.

3. Customize PyInstaller Options(Optional):

   - PyInstaller provides various options to customize the packaging process. You can specify options such as the
     name of the output executable, exclude certain modules or files, include additional files or directories,
     and more. You can find a list of available options in the PyInstaller documentation.

4. Test the Executable**: Once PyInstaller has finished packaging your application, navigate to the `dist`
   directory and run the generated executable to test it. Make sure it behaves as expected and includes all the
   necessary functionality.

5. Distribute Your Application: Now that you have a standalone executable for your Python web browser application,
   you can distribute it to others. You can upload it to a file-sharing platform, your own website, or a cloud
   storage service and provide users with a download link.

6. Provide Installation Instructions: Optionally, provide users with instructions on how to download and install
   your application. Include information about system requirements, installation steps, and any other relevant
   details.

7. Update and Maintain Your Application: Regularly update and maintain your application as needed. Address any
   issues reported by users, add new features, and release updates to improve the overall user experience.

By following these steps, you can use PyInstaller to package your Python-based web browser application into a
standalone executable and distribute it to users.
